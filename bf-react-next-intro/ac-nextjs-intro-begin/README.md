# Next.js intro

# Steps


- Right mouse click on the directory where you want the project and choose `Open In Integrated Terminal`.
- Install create-next-app globally with the following command.
	- `npm install -g create-next-app@latest`
- Create a project in the directory.
	- `npx create-next-app hello-next`
- Go to the newly created folder.
	- `cd hello-next`
- Run the project
	- `npm run dev`
- Change the title in the "pages/index.js" file in your "hello-next" project and see it change immediately on the page (this is hot module reload)
